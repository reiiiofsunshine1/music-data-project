Hello! I'm Rei, and this is my first independent data engineering project. 

In this project, I'm planning on making a data pipeline to analyze my favorite topics, music, specifically K-Pop (because, why not? :D)

I will be creating an ETL data pipeline that relies on batch processing (but who knows, maybe I'll add some streaming processes here).

Will be using:
- Apache Airflow for WMS
